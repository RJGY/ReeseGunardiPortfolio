                    Hey, my name is Reese and I am an aspiring fullstack developer and build just about anything and everything. I started coding as a teenager aged 14 when I was interested in modding video games and creating my own games. Since then, I discovered my passion for developing and completed my Bachelors of Information Technology at Central Queensland Univeristy and a Certificate IV in Interactive Games at St Leonards TAFE. I have also undertaken hackathons and game jams to further hone my skills.
